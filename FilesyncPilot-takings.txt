Question: 
How do I stop the background service?
Do I have to stop the service whenever I need to make a changes in the application?

can you tell me the entire program flow in simple english

example: application starts ➡ program.cs is initiated and check these particular things because reason and an analogy) ➡ then it moves to appsetting.js and check these particular lines (because reason and an analogy) ➡ then this .cs file checks the particular folder espcially this line checks it (because reason and an analogy) ➡ then this file checks the conditions and business logic (because reason and an analogy) ➡ finally this is done in this .cs or (some file name) and the program is ended or it keeps running in the background since we are hosted in window (because reason and an analogy)

For(Entire flow, particular function): create a flow diagram prompt for the entire process flow mentioned above also don't forget to mention the hidden background processes
also mention in which file the process is happening LoadConfiguration(program.cs -> which line)

==================

A file that contains the template that needed (secured) and placed somewhere
We can change or update the template in certain way then template contents appear in the dropped file, it process to either success or failure folder

later -> it move to concurrent department failure, success folder (Ex: Failure files in IRIS, Dianon, Legacy), (Ex: Success files in IRIS, Dianon, Legacy)
